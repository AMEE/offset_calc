AMEE CRC Calculator
===================

This is an example Rails application that uses AMEE to calculate emissions and then
submit the results to a carbon offsetter.

You can create your own copy of this application at http://my.amee.com/templates,
or you can use this codebase to run your own copy on your own servers. You may also
use it as a base from which to develop your own AMEE applications.
